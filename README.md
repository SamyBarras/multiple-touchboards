# multiple-touchboards
connect 2 or more touchboard together and use them as keyboard


these arduino sketches are based on BareConductive's "multi-board-touch-mp3" repository :
https://github.com/BareConductive/multi-board-touch-mp3


changes made are :
--> implement keyboard press/release when capacitive sensors detect touches
--> no mp3

it is used combined with projection mapping software for large interactive installations using conductive ink and more than 12 conductive zones...
